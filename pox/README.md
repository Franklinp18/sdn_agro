This is a placeholder directory for the POX controller framework.

Due to environment limitations, the full POX repository is not included in this archive. To obtain
the complete POX source code, clone the official repository from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/noxrepo/pox.git
```

The custom SDN controller module used in this project (`sdn_agro.py`) is provided in
`pox/ext/sdn_agro.py`. Once you have cloned POX, you can copy this file into the `ext`
directory of your cloned repository to reproduce the controller behavior.
